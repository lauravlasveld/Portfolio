                    Smelly is an mobile web app created for a Media company in Tilburg, called LiveWall. The app shows you what is left in your fridge, 
                     and when these itims will expire.
                      The app comes with a scanning feature that scans the receipt and stores them it's products in your virtual fridge.
                      When something in your fridge is about to expire you will get a notification. <br> <br>That is where 'Smelley' comes in. 
                      Smelley is the mascot of the app in the form of a dog. The dog is supposed to make the app more fun, and to keep the user motivated.
                       We even thought of a few Smelley games that could be played in the app, where one can actually be played.
